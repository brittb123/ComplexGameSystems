# What is this project?

This project is a complex systems of artificial intelligence being used to show my understanding of the unreal engine's AI system. This was a class project to make a complex system that is not to simple as well as be distrubuted or recreated. This project starts where there is no player in the game. The camera will be in a angle to see a building that was made with the AI wandering about. The bottom left the screen will have status bars that drain overtime. The AI priortizes the lowest percentage first.
